# VBA Homework: VBA of Wall Street

' I created a new repository called 'VBA-challenge' for this project

' I uploaded the following to my GitHub 'VBA-challenge' repository for my submission:

' I uploaded Screenshots for each year from the Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx file named 'year/hard_solution.png'

' I uploaded a separate .vb file containing the VBA script named 'VBA_of_WallStreet.vb'

' I uploaded this README.md file to accompany my submission

' I created a shareable link to my repository and submitted that link to <https://bootcampspot-v2.com>

' The VBA code is designed to run on every worksheet with just one execution
